> **Efficient line-by-line file reader** | ðŸš€ A sophisticated solution for buffered sequential file access in C
> ðŸ“œ Reads lines of any length from file descriptors without loading entire files into memory
---

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

**get_next_line** implements an advanced buffering system to:
- Read any file descriptor (files, stdin, sockets)
- Maintain state between calls with static variables
- Handle memory allocation optimally
- Process files of unlimited size
- Support multiple file descriptors simultaneously

```c
// Function prototype
char *get_next_line(int fd);
