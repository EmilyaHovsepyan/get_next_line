## ðŸ“Œ Description

`get_next_line` is a function that reads from a file descriptor and returns one line at a time, including the newline character. It handles buffering, memory allocation, and edge cases like end-of-file (EOF).

This project teaches dynamic memory handling, file reading, and persistent state between function calls.
